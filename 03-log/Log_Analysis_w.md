## 1. What is Log Analysis?
- Log analysis is the process of examining and interpreting log files generated by various systems, applications, or devices to gain insights, identify patterns, troubleshoot issues, and enhance security.
- Logs are usually stored in plain text format or custom formats and contain information about timestamps, IDs, IP addresses, errors, and other activities that occur within a system.
- Common NCL log files include SSH logs, web server logs, database logs, and application logs.

## 2. Tools for Log Analysis (Linux Commands)

### `cut`
- Used to extract specific fields from log files based on delimiters.
- flags:
  - `-d`: Specifies the delimiter (e.g., space, comma).
  - `-f`: Specifies the field(s) to extract.
- Example: `cut -d ' ' -f 1,3 access.log` extracts the first and third fields from the access.log file, using space as the delimiter.

### `awk`
- A powerful text processing tool that can be used to manipulate and analyze log files.
- flags:
  - `-F`: Specifies the field separator (e.g., space, comma).
  - `'{print $1, $3}'`: Specifies the fields to print (e.g., first and third fields).
- Example: 
  - `awk '{print $1, $3}' access.log`: prints the first and third fields of each line in the access.log file.
  - `awk '{if ($3 == "error") print $0}' access.log`: prints lines where the third field is "error".
  - `awk -F ',' '"200$" {print $1}' access.log`: prints the first field of lines where the last field ends with "200".


### `grep`
- Used to search for specific patterns or keywords in log files.
### `sort`
- Used to sort log entries based on specific fields.
### `uniq`
- Used to filter out duplicate log entries.
### `wc`
- Used to count the number of lines, words, or characters in log files.
### `sed`
- A stream editor used for filtering and transforming text in log files.
### `tail`
- Used to display the last few lines of a file.
### `head`
- Used to display the first few lines of a file.
