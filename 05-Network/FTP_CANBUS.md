## 1. Network Traffic Analysis
- Network traffic analysis is the process of intercepting, recording, and analyzing network traffic to understand the behavior of a network, identify potential security threats, and troubleshoot network issues.
- Tools commonly used for network traffic analysis include Wireshark, tcpdump, and NetworkMiner.
- Network traffic analysis can be used to identify malicious activity, such as unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and malware communication.

## 2. FTP
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server over a TCP/IP network.
- FTP operates on two separate channels: the control channel for sending commands and receiving responses, and the data channel for transferring files.
- FTP can be used for both anonymous and authenticated file transfers, and it supports various authentication methods, including username/password and anonymous access.
- FTP is commonly used for uploading and downloading files to and from web servers, as well as for sharing files within a network.

## 3. CAN BUS
- CAN BUS (Controller Area Network) is a robust vehicle bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other without a host computer.
- CAN BUS is widely used in automotive and industrial applications for communication between various electronic control units (ECUs) in a vehicle or machinery.
- CAN BUS operates on a multi-master, message-oriented protocol, where each device can send and receive messages, but only one device can transmit at a time.
- CAN BUS messages consist of an identifier, data length code, and data payload, and they can be used to control various functions in a vehicle, such as engine performance, braking, and lighting systems.
