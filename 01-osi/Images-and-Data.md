# Images and Data

## Metadata

Metadata (or Meta) refers to information about an image file that describes details about the image, such as file type, file size, image resolution, or descriptive keywords. Metadata typically belongs to one of three metadata fields: technical, descriptive, and administrative.

### Technical Metadata

Techincal Metadata is information about the structure of the image file itself. Examples include the file type, file size, date created, the uploader, and camera settings. Techincal Metadata is usually generated automatically by the file source.

### Descriptive Metadata

Descriptive Metadata is keywords that are added to the image which describe what it is an image of or who took the picture. This metadata is the type that will be used for searches in image libraries.

### Administrative Metadata 

Administrative Metadata is information on how an image is allowed to be used, such as licensing right and any expirations on said rights.

Metadata is often viewable from wherever the image is being stored. Adding or editing metadata will require specialized editing software, such as [metadata2go.com](https://www.metadata2go.com/).

Using metadata2go just by uploading this image I was able to answer the following questions about it:

- When was the image created? (Round to the nearest minute)

Next to "create\_date" I found "2015:05:15 02:14:22" meaning that this image was created on May 15th, 2015 at 2:14 AM.

- What is the image size in pixels? (ex: 800x600)

Next to "image\_size" I found "1024x768" meaning the image is 1024 pixels wide by 768 pixels tall.

- What is the make of the camera that took the picture?

Next to "make" I found "Apple" meaning that this picture was taken with an iPhone (unless there was an Apple standalone camera that I've never heard of).

- What is the model of the camera that took the picture?

Next to "model" I found "Apple iPhone 5" confriming that this was taken using an iPhone.

- What is the exposure time for the picture? (ex: 1/200)

Next to "exposure\_time" I found "1/640" meaning the camera's shutter is open for one six hundred fortieth of a second.

- Where was the picture taken? Please use only positive numbers with 4 decimal places. (ex: 45.4000N, 75.6667W)

Next to "gps\_position" I found "39 deg 52' 30.00" N, 20 deg 0' 36.00" E" which are DMS coordinates. After converting to decimal coordinates this picture was taken at 39.8750N and 20.01E.

## Barcode

Barcodes are a way of representing numbers by encoding each number to a specific pattern of lines. Each number is set to a pattern of lines that will not resemble any other pattern if flipped upside down. The barcode scanner then reads the patterns seeing each black or white line as either 1 or 0 respectively. The binary from the scanner is then sent to a computer which decodes the numbers based on the set patterns that it already knows.

### QR Codes

QR codes are a type of 2D barcode that by going in two directions can have much more encoded information than a traditional barcode. They are also much easier for regular cameras to read and can be encrypted. These work much like traditional barcodes where the diffrent colored sections have encoded information that can be read by your smartphone or other device.

You can read a barcode without a camera or specialized scanner using online tools like the [Inlite Barcode Reader](https://online-barcode-reader.inliteresearch.com/).

Using that site I was able to answer the following questions about this barcode by uploading it to the website:
