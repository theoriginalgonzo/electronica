# Images and Data

## Metadata

Metadata (or Meta) refers to information about an image file that describes details about the image, such as file type, file size, image resolution, or descriptive keywords. Metadata typically belongs to one of three metadata fields: technical, descriptive, and administrative.

### Technical Metadata

Techincal Metadata is information about the structure of the image file itself. Examples include the file type, file size, date created, the uploader, and camera settings. Techincal Metadata is usually generated automatically by the file source.

### Descriptive Metadata

Descriptive Metadata is keywords that are added to the image which describe what it is an image of or who took the picture. This metadata is the type that will be used for searches in image libraries.

### Administrative Metadata 

Administrative Metadata is information on how an image is allowed to be used, such as licensing right and any expirations on said rights.

Metadata is often viewable from wherever the image is being stored. Adding or editing metadata will require specialized editing software, and for large scale opperations some form of digital asset management (DAM) system.
