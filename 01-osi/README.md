## Web

- HTTP Headers
  - URL 
    - A type of URI that specify the location of resources and how to access it.
  - URI
    - General identifier for resources that identify resources by name and location or both. ALL URLs are URIs but not all URIs are URLs.
  - Protocols
    - Protocols are set of rules that define how data sent and received 
    - HTTP for transfer web page
    - HTTPS for secure HTTP
    - FTP for file transfer
    - SMTP for sending mail
    - DNS for Domain name resolution

  - add GET, POST, and FTP equivalents
    - GET 
        - used to request data, parameters in URL, doesn't change server state
    - POST
        - used to send data, data in request body, can change server state
    - FTP
        - FTP used for upload and download files
        - used control channel and data channel



- To solve the question about headers you have to pick up keywords from the question and search those keywords on this site with ctrl + F [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields#Request_fields) It takes time to find right http header.


- SSL
  - SSL certificate chains
    - SSL certificate chains establish trust by linking a website’s certificate to a trusted root Certificate Authority through one or more intermediate CAs(certificate authorities).
  - add CSA and trust

    - A Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted third party that:

        - Issues SSL certificates

        - Verifies website identities

        - Signs certificates cryptographically

    - Trust in SSL means:

        - Your browser already trusts certain root CAs

        - These trusted root certificates are preinstalled in the OS/browser

        - If a website’s certificate chains up to one of these roots → it is trusted

        - If it does not → warning 


- To solve the question from this section you have to go to site information you can access that from clicking left side of icon(== something like that) in url bar. From there you have to click "connection secure" and after that you have to click "certificate is valid". Now you can see the details like issued to or issued by in genral tab. if you go to details you can certificate heirachy and other details.
