## Web

- HTTP Headers
  - URL 
    - A type of URI that specify the location of resources and how to access it.
  - URI
    - General identifier for resources that identify resources by name and location or both. ALL URLs are URIs but not all URIs are URLs.
  - Protocols
    - Protocols are set of rules that define how data sent and received 
    - HTTP for transfer web page
    - HTTPS for secure HTTP
    - FTP for file transfer
    - SMTP for sending mail
    - DNS for Domain name resolution

  - add GET, POST, and FTP equivalents
    - GET 
        - used to request data, parameters in URL, doesn't change server state
    - POST
        - used to send data, data in request body, can change server state
    - FTP
        - FTP used for upload and download files
        - used control channel and data channel

```

To solve the question about headers you have to pick up keywords from the question and search those keywords on this site with ctrl + F [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields#Request_fields) It takes time to find right http header.
