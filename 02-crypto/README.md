Bases, encoding, and encryption
simple encoding (from number bases gym)

number bases

    you can view hexadecimal data using command line tools like xxd
    you can even edit and save this data using vim!
        open the file you want to edit vim encoding-example
        start an xxd buffer in vim :%!xxd then edit the hex values
        close the buffer and view the results! :%!xxd -r
        save the new data if you so choose :wq

Topics to cover for the week:

    Password cracking / hash cracking
        focus on john the ripper
        find top 500 passwords list
        find rockyou.txt but DO NOT include it in your repository (too big)
        solve the pokemon gym challenge for week 2 using john
            again, take notes useful for others to crack passwords / make wordlists / permutations
    Windows and PDF password cracking
        focus on both john AND ophcrack
        solve PDF and Windows gyms for week 2 and take notes
        find some example windows hashes (online)
        document where hashed passwords are on Windows XP, 7, 10, and 11 (how to retrieve them)
    Data and encoding
        base64 encode and decode (can you do it similar to above for xxd inside vim?)
        strings gym for week 2
            find out how to view the challenge flag via given the above vim tips to view the image as hex
        side challenge on a linux only system:
            cleanly format a USB drive
            mount it and make a text file with some unique known contents
            delete the text file using rm
            unmount the drive (but still leave it attached so it is in /dev)
            run strings on the USB drive hardware device directly: ie. sudo strings /dev/sdb
        Other challenge working with encryption person:
            take the encrypted tux.png (from your encryption person) and find out how to use dd or vim with xxd (above) and overwrite JUST the bytes of the image that correspond to the .png header and meta data, take this data from the original tux.png. Then rename the encrypted file as a .png and view it in an image viewer.
            document this header / file carving process
    Cypher / crypto
        cyberchef local install?
        cyberchef notes
        quipquip notes
        solve shift, french, strings, bash, fencing gyms.
            notes on how to use above tools to solve gyms
            notes on any command line tools that do the same
    Encryption (RSA / GPG)
        openssl, document using openssl to encrypt / decrypt files using 128-bit CBC, 128-bit ECB, and 128-bit OFB symmetric encryption
            encrypt tux.png with all three methods above and give to the Data and encoding person
        Watch / do the RSA gym in week 2
        will also use cyberchef
        may use command line
        send me an encrypted email (via thunderbird)
    Have and extra person? Install Kali linux (VM via virtualbox) or on a spare laptop in room!
        This person can tackle the USB drive data and encoding challenge
        work with the linux password person to find the wordlists needed in kali linux.
